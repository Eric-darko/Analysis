📊 Data Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the World Happiness Report, which provides annual data on the state of global happiness based on various factors.

📋 Data Description

Features: The dataset includes variables such as:
GDP per Capita: Economic performance metric.
Social Support: Community and social relationships.
Life Expectancy: Health indicator.
Freedom to Make Life Choices: Personal autonomy.
Generosity: Philanthropic behaviors.
Corruption Perception: Trust in government and business.
The dataset consists of 158 and is analyzed to derive insights related to happiness scores.

📈 Models Used

The analysis includes the following models:

Linear Regression: To evaluate the relationship between various factors and happiness scores, achieving an accuracy of 98%.
Random Forest: Employed for predicting happiness scores with improved accuracy after hyperparameter tuning, achieving 99%

📈 Results & Insights

Key findings from the analysis include:

Economic Factors: A strong correlation between GDP per capita and happiness scores.
Social Support: Countries with higher social support tend to report greater happiness levels.
Impact of Corruption: Nations with lower perceptions of corruption generally have higher happiness ratings.
